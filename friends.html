<h1> Friends</h1>
<p> To start this story I'm gonna go in the order of the people I met.</p>

<p> Olivia Marsala was the first person I met at Molloy not considering the people who I knew prior to starting.</p>

<h2> Shiloh Bennet </h2>
<p> Shiloh is the reason I am a music major. I met Shiloh during my FST class and he told me how the Jazz ensemble needed a bassist which I happen to be. After joining that i was requested to join the Molloy Sinfonetta and once I joined that I realized I need to pursue what I loved and that meant getting a degree in music. Through Shiloh I met a majority of my friends at Molloy and found the courage to pursue what I truley wanted in life</p>
