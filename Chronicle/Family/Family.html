<h1> Family <a id=Top></a></h1>
<p> This year was the start of a bunch of new things. My sister started a new Job, my other sister changed her major, my father started going back to school for his Docterate and my mother was promoted to a managerial position in her unit at the Hospital. A lot of big movements for my family. </p>

<h2> Church </h2>
<p> I consider my church, especially the youth my age, part of my family. They've known me since I was two years old and are some of the most important people in my life.</p>
<p> My dad was called to Pastor over a church in yonkers. This has kinda made things complicated. Currently, because of the lack of youth at the church my dad will be taking over, I will still be residing in EFGCOG, my current church. </p>
