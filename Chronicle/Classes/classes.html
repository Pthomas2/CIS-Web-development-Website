<h1 class = "top"> Freshmen Year </h1>
<div id = "firstSemester">
<h2>First Semester </h2>
<p class = "eh"> When I started this year I started as a plain CIS major with just a few normal classes.</p>
<h2 id = "class_title">Discrete Math Structures</h2>
<p id = "description">This class I took under Prof. Manyiu Tse. He seemed to be an interesting guy but I dont think he really enjoyed me as a student in this class because I wouldnt hand in assignments. To me he seemed like a good teacher. His teaching style worked for me but to the other kids in his class they didnt really seem to like his teaching style. Either way I got a hundred on the final and still ended up with a C. but at least I paased.</p>
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" >Elem. Statistics</h2>
<p id = "description">This is another class I took with Manyiu Tse. Within this class I think I was Prof. Tse's better students. It was a much easier class than discrete so I tended to participate more and got higher grades. He still gave me a B at the end of the semester but by the end i began to slack due to myself getting more and more involved in the music department.</p>
</div>
<h2 id = "class_title"> FST </h2>
<p id = "description"> This class was probably the most useless class I've attended in my life. It gave me less information than I could have found on the school website. This class did allow me to meet some interesting people and in this class is actually where i met my friend Shiloh Bennet. Shiloh is the one who got me involved in the music program and basically introduced me to 90% of the friends i currently have at Molloy. So I guess I cant be completely ungrateful for this class.</p>
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" class = "other"> Sociology </h2> 
<p id = "description" class = "other"> This class was very interesting. I still  somehow managed to fall asleep in it every class. The proffessor tended to go on long rants on information that was relevant to the topic but not actually relevant for the class. </p>
</div>
<h2 id = "class_title"> Music Insight </h2>
<p id = "description"> The proffessor fo this class flip flopped every week on whether he was on my good or bad side. Since I already was a music student and knew a lot of the information especially the musical theory I would get annoyed when he dumbed down the concepts he would teach to the point where he would start twisting the definitions. He marked points off my tests when i would use the true definition of certain terms vs the definitions he would give us in class. He would also give us facts contardicting what was given in the textbook. Which i only knew because other people raised the questions about it. I returned the textbook for that class in its original packaging unopened. The class over all was an easy A and gave me a break from the work of my other classes.</p>
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" class = "other"> CIS 102 </h2>
<p id = "description" class = "other"> This class was a smooth sailing class. We only met up about once a week and each time  we spent a lot of the time conversing. The content was very light and the assignments were very easy so it wasnt a class that needed a lot of time to be invested into. The class overall was supposed to be three hours every thursday night but more often than not ended within an hour and a half. 
</p>
</div> 
<h2 id = "class_title"> Sinofnetta and Jazz Band </h2>
<p id = "description"> These classes are the classes which had me switch into becoming a double major. I met a kid named Shiloh in my FST class. After discussing our different majors I found out he was a music major. I started asking him about the program here and he started telling about how he came there and the different ensembles that he was in. Before he even knew I played bass he was telling me about how they needed a bass player for the jazz band. I told him i played and he asked me to come around to their next rehersal. I came and played for them and they liked the sound so they kept me. Later on the director of the sinfonetta heard that i was playing bass for the jazz band and asked me to come play for Molloy's Orchestra. I joined and as I progressed I realized this is what i wanted to continue to pursue in my career path.

<div id = "second_semester">
<h2> Second Semester</h2>
<p class = "eh"> I took a heavier course load this semester. I at this point am fully a double major in both music performance and CIS.</p>
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" class = "other"> Harmony 1 </h2>
<p id = "description" class = "other"> Molloy calls their music theory classes Harmony classes becuase they follow a system of Tonal Harmony. This class was taught by Sam Wells. He as a phenomenal trumpet player. He is also a composer. I had already taken AP Music Theory in High School so the content we covered passed over the content in this class and even went into what I will most likely be learning next semester in Harmony 2. This was very helpful becuase it really alleviated the stress of trying to manage this class.
</p> 
</div>
<h2 id = "class_title"> Sight Singing  </h2>
<p id = "description"> This class was taught by Michelle Rampall. Michelle Rampall has an ability that is very rare. She has perfect pitch. For those of you who dont know this means she knows which note is being played/sung at any time without any point of reference. This made the class very difficult because even the slightest wavers in pitches being flat or sharp were pointeds out to us. The class all together was very fun though it was difficult. </p>  
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" class = "other"> Visual Programming and Intro to web development  </h2>
<p id = "description" class = "other"> These two classes showed me that i actually enjoy the technology side of things more than the human aspect of CIS. I also realized I enjoyed programming and even through I'm not very good I want to get better and actually become a developer. I won't speak much more on these considering that I'm presenting this in class  </p> 
</div>
<h2 id = "class_title"> BUS 101</h2>
<p id = "description"> The most boring class I've ever taken in my life. The class was taught by a very nice but extremly boring proffesor who constantly included personal antedotes on his buisness expereience and his political opinons with which i didnt disagree but felt it was unnecesary to be disscussed in class. </p> 
<div class = "other">
<h2 id = "class_title" class = "other"> Music History</h2>
<p id = "description" class = "other"> Music History was a terrible course. I enjoy history but i could not process all of the information the class gave us. It was very dense content and the textbook itsef was densly worded. It was also a hybrid class so it only met once a week which was nice yet this was a class that needed more than one meeting time a week to really help comprehend the information. Over all the class was an absolute terrible exprience </p> 
</div>
<h2 id = "class_title"> Jazz and Percussion</h2>
<p id = "description"> This semester due to the timing of classes I was not able to continue in the orchestra. I did however join the percussion ensemble. This is going to become intersting next semester becuase i have plans to be in all three which will severly cut into the time I have in a day. I will probably die before the next semester finishes. </p>
